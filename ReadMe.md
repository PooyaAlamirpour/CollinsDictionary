# CollinsDictionary
CollinsDictionary is an open source application for getting the definitions from [Collins Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/definition) site. I am going to implement an open source plug-in for browsers based on this application.

## Usage
Just download and install Visual Studio and then clone [this](https://github.com/PooyaAlamirpour/CollinsDictionary) repository. Feel free to ask me if there is any question.
